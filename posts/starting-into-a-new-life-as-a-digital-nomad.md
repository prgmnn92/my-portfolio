# Starting into a new life as a digital nomad

**What do you want from life?**

My wife and I have decided to quit our permanent, well-paying, full-time jobs and go traveling.

Why? We no longer want to live just to work. We want to work to live! We want the **freedom** to decide for ourselves: To decide when, where and how much we work — to no longer fit into strict patterns.

That’s why we are taking some time off and will follow the path of **Digital Nomads**. The flight and the first accommodation are already booked. We will start in July. And who would have guessed, it goes to Bali. 😛

To keep us afloat we have saved something and want to earn additional money as freelancer.

What exactly we plan to do during our trip and still follows! ☝️

Join us on the exciting journey to a Digital Nomad existence: I’ll share our preparations, updates, insights and experiences with you every 2 weeks.

Cheers
